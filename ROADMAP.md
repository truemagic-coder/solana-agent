# Roadmap

Below is an updated roadmap for Solana Agent, incorporating a self-learning IT helpdesk solution, agent handoffs to human operators, cross-domain innovation, and an open-source tooling version. The other phases remain largely the same, but Phase 2 is completely replaced based on your requests.

---

## Phase 1: Core Foundation

- **Core Framework Stability**  
  - Refine Solana Agent’s multi-agent swarm architecture for improved scalability.  
  - Ensure backward compatibility and strengthen public APIs.  
  - Increase test coverage to ensure reliability in real-world scenarios.

- **Initial IT Helpdesk Proof of Concept**  
  - Create specialized agents for networking, software, hardware, and security support.  
  - Integrate a basic knowledge base with company documentation (e.g., common troubleshooting steps).  
  - Develop a minimal web interface or CLI to handle user queries.

## Phase 2 (New): Agent Handoffs, Cross-Domain Innovation, & Open-Source Tooling

- **Agent Handoffs to Human Operators**  
  - Implement a seamless escalation pipeline from AI agents to human support staff.  
  - Enable real-time collaboration between automated agents and live helpdesk operators.  
  - Provide human operators with conversation context and historical ticket data for smoother transitions.

- **Cross-Domain Collaboration for Innovation**  
  - Enhance synergy among specialized agents (e.g., networking, software, security) to jointly tackle complex issues.  
  - Introduce automated “innovation sessions” where agents collaboratively propose creative solutions or optimizations.  
  - Consolidate multi-domain knowledge to identify cross-cutting problems and novel resolution strategies.

- **Open-Source Only Version**  
  - Create a variant of Solana Agent that relies entirely on open-source LLMs, vector databases, and search tools (e.g., local models, Elasticsearch, Milvus).  
  - Provide a separate installation guide for the fully open-source stack, ensuring organizations can deploy without proprietary dependencies.  
  - Validate performance and feature parity compared to proprietary models where possible.

- **IT Helpdesk Enhancements**  
  - Expand ticket management features with advanced search and structured incident tracking.  
  - Introduce “smart triage” capabilities to filter high-priority IT issues for immediate resolution.  
  - Integrate knowledge extraction from newly resolved tickets to continuously refine the helpdesk’s expertise.

## Phase 3: Enterprise Integration & Security

- **Enterprise-Ready Features**  
  - Strengthen security and encryption for corporate environments.  
  - Provide role-based access control to ensure secure agent usage.  
  - Offer high-availability setups (clustering, load-balancing) for mission-critical deployments.

- **Collaboration with Existing Systems**  
  - Integrate with enterprise ITSM solutions (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira Service Management).  
  - Establish reporting dashboards for analytics (metrics on query volume, resolution times, agent accuracy).

- **IT Helpdesk Production Deployment**  
  - Roll out advanced problem classification using natural language understanding.  
  - Incorporate recommended solutions for recurring issues before escalation to higher-level support.  
  - Adapt routing of tickets to specialized agents automatically based on recognized patterns.

---

## Phase 4: Advanced AGI & Ongoing Improvement

- **Collective Swarm Intelligence**  
  - Deepen cross-domain collaboration between specialized agents to tackle large-scale, multi-step problems.  
  - Integrate distributed cognition for enhanced knowledge discovery and integration.

- **Autonomous Agent Lifecycle**  
  - Implement dynamic agent creation/retirement based on usage data and knowledge gaps.  
  - Add meta-agents capable of orchestrating large sets of specialized AI modules.

- **IT Helpdesk Intelligent Automation**  
  - Predict potential system failures and automate proactive ticket creation.  
  - Expand root-cause analysis using correlations between logs, monitoring data, and historical resolutions.  
  - Continuously refine knowledge to adapt to evolving IT infrastructures.

---

## Phase 5: Ecosystem Expansion

- **Plugin Ecosystem**  
  - Build a plugin marketplace for community-driven extensions.  
  - Foster an open-source community for collaborative research and development.  
  - Scale into specialized verticals like healthcare, finance, and legal with targeted agent categories.

- **Research Collaborations**  
  - Partner with academic institutions to experiment with emerging AGI approaches.  
  - Use real-world learnings from the IT helpdesk domain to advance swarm intelligence research.

This roadmap ensures Solana Agent remains flexible, scalable, and fully capable of supporting both enterprise-grade IT helpdesk operations and broader AGI ambitions. By adding human-agent handoffs, cross-domain innovation, and a fully open-source version, the framework becomes a powerful, adaptable solution for a wide range of use cases.
