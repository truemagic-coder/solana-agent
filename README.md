## Installation

You can install Solana Agent using pip:

`pip install solana-agent`

## Flows

In both flows of single and multiple agents - it is one user query to one agent using one tool (if needed).

An agent can have multiple tools and will choose the best one to answer the user query.

Routing is determined by optimal domain expertise of the agent for the user query.

When the agent uses a tool it feeds the tool output back to itself to generate the final response.

This is important as tools generally output unstructured and unformatted data that the agent needs to prepare for the user.

Keep this in mind while designing your agentic systems using Solana Agent.

## Usage

### Text/Text Streaming

```python
from solana_agent import SolanaAgent

config = {
    "openai": {
        "api_key": "your-openai-api-key",
    },
    "agents": [
        {
            "name": "research_specialist",
            "instructions": "You are an expert researcher who synthesizes complex information clearly.",
            "specialization": "Research and knowledge synthesis",
        },
        {
            "name": "customer_support",
            "instructions": "You provide friendly, helpful customer support responses.",
            "specialization": "Customer inquiries",
        }
    ],
}

solana_agent = SolanaAgent(config=config)

async for response in solana_agent.process("user123", "What are the latest AI developments?"):
    print(response, end="")
```

Single Agent:

* OpenAI API calls with no tool call = 1 (agent)

* OpenAI API calls with tool call = 2 (agent, agent)

Multiple Agents:

* OpenAI API calls with no tool call = 2 (router, agent)

* OpenAI API calls with tool call = 3 (router, agent, agent)

### Audio/Audio Streaming

```python
from solana_agent import SolanaAgent

config = {

* OpenAI API calls with tool call = 4 (router, audio transcribe, agent, agent)

## Optional Feature Configs

### Business Alignment

```python
config = {
    "business": {
        "mission": "To provide users with a one-stop shop for their queries.",
        "values": {
            "Friendliness": "Users must be treated fairly, openly, and with friendliness.",
            "Ethical": "Agents must use a strong ethical framework in their interactions with users.",
        },
        "goals": [
            "Empower users with great answers to their queries.",
        ],
        "voice": "The voice of the brand is that of a research business."
    },
}
```

### Conversational History

```python
config = {
    "mongo": {
        "connection_string": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
        "database": "solana_agent"
    },
}
```

### Conversational Memory

```python
config = {
    "zep": {
        "api_key": "your-zep-cloud-api-key",
    },
}
```

API Calls:

* Zep adds 2 API calls per user query (GET and POST)

* If the Zep user and session isn't created it creates them for 2 API calls (POST)

### Internet Search

This mode is great for text output where the default response from OpenAI is enough.

It is not suitable for audio as the OpenAI search results contain links and markdown.

Also it may not call tools when they should be called as it thinks the search results answer the user query.

It is much faster than calling `search_internet` from `sakit` as it saves 2 API calls.

```python
async for response in solana_agent.process("user123", "What is the latest news on Canada?", internet_search=True):
    print(response, end="")
```

### Customize Speech

This is an audio to audio example using the `audio_instructions` parameter.

You can prompt to control aspects of speech, including:

* Accent
* Emotional range
* Intonation
* Impressions
* Speed of speech
* Tone
* Whispering

```python
async for response in solana_agent.process("user123", audio_content, output_format="audio", audio_voice="nova", audio_input_format="webm", audio_output_format="aac", audio_instructions="You speak with an American southern accent"):
    print(response, end="")
```

## Tools

Tools can be used from plugins like Solana Agent Kit (sakit) or via inline tools. Tools available via plugins integrate automatically with Solana Agent.

* Agents can only call one tool per response
* Agents choose the best tool for the job
* Tools do not use OpenAI function calling
* Tools are async functions

### Plugin Tool Example

`pip install sakit`

```python
from solana_agent import SolanaAgent

config = {
    "openai": {
        "api_key": "your-openai-api-key",
    },
    "tools": {
        "search_internet": {
            "api_key": "your-openai-api-key",
        },
    },
    "agents": [
        {
            "name": "research_specialist",
            "instructions": "You are an expert researcher who synthesizes complex information clearly. You use your search_internet tool to get the latest information.",
            "specialization": "Research and knowledge synthesis",
            "tools": ["search_internet"],
        },
        {
            "name": "customer_support",
            "instructions": "You provide friendly, helpful customer support responses.",
            "specialization": "Customer inquiries",
        }
    ],
}

solana_agent = SolanaAgent(config=config)

async for response in solana_agent.process("user123", "What are the latest AI developments?"):
    print(response, end="")
```

### Inline Tool Example

```python
from solana_agent import SolanaAgent
from solana_agent.interfaces.plugins.plugins import Tool

class TestTool(Tool):
    def __init__(self):
        # your tool initialization - delete the following pass
        pass

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "test_function"

    @property
    def description(self) -> str:
        return "Test function for Solana Agent"

    def configure(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        """Configure with all possible API key locations."""
        super().configure(config)

        # read your config values - delete the following pass
        pass

    def get_schema(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # this is an example schema
        return {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Search query text"},
                "user_id": {"type": "string", "description": "User ID for the search session"}
            },
            "required": ["query", "user_id"]
        }

    async def execute(self, **params) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        try:
            # your tool logic
            result = "Your tool results"

            return {
                "status": "success",
                "result": result,
            }
        except Exception as e:
            return {
                "status": "error",
                "message": f"Error: {str(e)}",
            }

config = {
    "openai": {
        "api_key": "your-openai-api-key",
    },
    "agents": [
        {
            "name": "research_specialist",
            "instructions": "You are an expert researcher who synthesizes complex information clearly.",
            "specialization": "Research and knowledge synthesis",
        },
        {
            "name": "customer_support",
            "instructions": "You provide friendly, helpful customer support responses.",
            "specialization": "Customer inquiries",
        }
    ],
}

solana_agent = SolanaAgent(config=config)

test_tool = TestTool()

solana_agent.register_tool("customer_support", test_tool)

async for response in solana_agent.process("user123", "What are the latest AI developments?"):
    print(response, end="")
```

## Agent Training

Many use cases for Solana Agent require training your agents on your company data.

This can be accomplished via runtime prompt injection. Integrations that work well with this method are vector stores like Pinecone and FAQs.

This knowledge is accessible to all your AI agents.

```python
from solana_agent import SolanaAgent

config = {
    "openai": {
        "api_key": "your-openai-api-key",
    },
    "agents": [
        {
            "name": "customer_support",
            "instructions": "You provide friendly, helpful customer support responses.",
            "specialization": "Customer inquiries",
        }
    ],
}

solana_agent = SolanaAgent(config=config)

async for response in solana_agent.process("user123", "How do replace the latch on my dishwasher?", "This is my corporate appliance fixing FAQ"):
    print(response, end="")
```

## Custom Routing

In advanced cases like implementing a ticketing system on-top of Solana Agent - you can use your own router.

```python
from solana_agent import SolanaAgent
from solana_agent.interfaces.services.routing import RoutingService as RoutingServiceInterface

config = {
    "openai": {
        "api_key": "your-openai-api-key",
    },
    "agents": [
        {
            "name": "research_specialist",
            "instructions": "You are an expert researcher who synthesizes complex information clearly.",
            "specialization": "Research and knowledge synthesis",
        },
        {
            "name": "customer_support",
            "instructions": "You provide friendly, helpful customer support responses.",
            "specialization": "Customer inquiries",
        }
    ],
}

class Router(RoutingServiceInterface)
    def __init__(self):
        # your router initialization - delete the following pass
        pass

    async def route_query(self, query: str) -> str:
        # a simple example to route always to customer_support agent
        return "customer_support"

router = Router()

solana_agent = SolanaAgent(config=config)

async for response in solana_agent.process("user123", "What are the latest AI developments?", router=router):
    print(response, end="")
```
