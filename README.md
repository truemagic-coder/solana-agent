**Craft AGI systems that evolve beyond imagination!**

Solana Agent is the first definitive AGI framework. Unlike traditional AI frameworks that stay static after deployment, Solana Agent continuously learns, adapts, and enhances its own capabilities through autonomous exploration and collective intelligence.

## Why Solana Agent?

### ü§ñ The Definitive AGI Framework

Unlike traditional AI assistants that forget conversations after each session, Solana Agent combines persistent memory, autonomous learning, and collective intelligence into a system that grows smarter with every interaction.

**Why This Matters:**
- üêù **Swarm Intelligence**: Distributes cognition across specialized agents with shared knowledge
- üìö **Continuous Learning**: Identifies and autonomously fills knowledge gaps
- üîÑ **Self-Improvement**: Detects confidence levels and researches weak areas automatically
- üß† **Collective Memory**: Cross-user insights enriching the entire system's capabilities
- üéØ **Context-Aware**: Recalls past interactions for more relevant responses
- üõ°Ô∏è **Enterprise-Ready**: Production-stable with privacy controls and deployment flexibility

## Features

### üó£Ô∏è **Advanced Interaction Layer**
- Streaming text-based conversations with real-time thinking
- Voice-to-voice conversations with natural cadence
- Multi-turn context preservation and reasoning

### üß† **Autonomous Learning Engine**
- Self-improving system that detects knowledge gaps through confidence monitoring
- Automatically schedules research tasks to strengthen weak knowledge areas
- Continuously enhances collective memory through insight extraction
- Prioritizes learning based on user interaction patterns and task importance
- Creates virtuous learning loops without human intervention

### ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Swarm Architecture**
- Dynamic specialized agent creation and coordination
- Intelligent routing based on query content and agent expertise
- Seamless handoffs with comprehensive context passing
- Parallel processing capabilities for complex multi-part questions
- Shared memory and collective intelligence across the entire swarm

### üîç **Multi-Source Knowledge Integration**
- Real-time internet search via Perplexity API
- Social media monitoring via X/Twitter (Grok API)
- Long-term conversational memory with Zep's graph-based storage
- Structured data analysis with CSV processing and summarization
- Vector-based knowledge retrieval with semantic search
- Hybrid search combining vector similarity and text relevance

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced Task Orchestration**
- Scheduled tasks with one-time, recurring, and conditional execution
- Long-running background operations for resource-intensive processing
- Asynchronous execution model preventing conversation blocking
- Comprehensive task status tracking and result delivery
- Cross-agent task delegation and completion verification

### üåê **Collective Swarm Intelligence**
- Hybrid semantic-keyword search spanning all user interactions
- Privacy-preserving knowledge extraction from conversations
- Self-organizing knowledge base with automatic categorization
- Cross-domain insight discovery and connection building
- Autonomous knowledge refinement through verification tasks

### üï∞Ô∏è **Time-Aware Intelligence**
- User-specific timezone handling for personalized time references
- Precise time-based scheduling and reminders with NTP synchronization
- Chronologically accurate responses across all conversations
- Default timezone fallbacks at both agent and swarm levels
- Seamless timezone preservation during agent handoffs

## Privacy and Collective Memory

Solana Agent's collective memory system is designed with privacy in mind:

- **Selective Knowledge Extraction**: Only factual, non-personal information is extracted
- **Privacy Filtering**: The AI is instructed to exclude user-specific details, opinions, and sensitive information
- **Optional Feature**: Easily disable collective memory with the `enable_collective_memory=False` parameter
- **Transparency**: Extracted insights are accessible and reviewable
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Adjust what qualifies as a valuable insight worth sharing

When collective memory is enabled, the system extracts valuable factual knowledge that can benefit all users, while carefully avoiding personal or sensitive information. For environments with stricter privacy requirements, the feature can be completely disabled.

## Time Awareness

Solana Agent's time awareness system ensures your AI assistants always provide chronologically accurate responses based on each user's timezone:

- **User-Based Time Context**: Pass user timezone directly in conversation requests
- **Global Time Management**: Get precise time in any timezone using NTP synchronization
- **Timezone Preservation**: Maintains timezone context during agent handoffs
- **Default Fallbacks**: Configurable defaults at both agent and swarm levels
- **Contextual Date Awareness**: All agents understand "today," "next week," or "in 3 days" relative to user's timezone

## Why Choose Solana Agent Over LangChain?
